For testing:

1. cd to the root of this repository
2. Run src/lib/pre-install
3. Run grunt

This will open three windows in your browser.
Files in the htdocs directory (e.g. index.php) will show up here:
http://localhost:8880/dyfi/index.php

Editing the files in src and test directories will automagically compile in the [repo]/.build/ directory.

When done, make sure to exit out of the 'grunt' process (Ctrl-C).

The default test data directory is in [thisrepo]/test/. Change this with the pre-install script.
